<p><strong>Tongues</strong></p>
<p>Those with the gift of <strong>Tongues</strong> may speak in other languages as the Spirit enables them (Acts 2); may speak in an unknown language (that of &ldquo;angels&rdquo;-1 Cor. 13); may speak to God in tongues (1 Cor. 14). Scripture says in addition to tongues being other languages it is also a way of &ldquo;uttering the mysteries of the Spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;sounding a clear call&rdquo; to God&rsquo;s people (1 Cor. 14). To be understood by the Body, tongues must be accompanied by the gift of Interpretation of Tongues.</p>
