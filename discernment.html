<p><strong>Discernment </strong></p>
<p>The spiritual gift of <strong>Discernment</strong> is the God-given ability, through His Holy Spirit, to distinguish between good and evil, truth and error, right and wrong, in a way that is helpful to the Body of Christ.People with the gift of discernment, as with the other gifts, are essential to the church&rsquo;s life and ministry.These people provide much-needed insight, point out inconsistencies in the teaching of God&rsquo;s Word, challenge deceitfulness in others, and help sort out impure motives from pure ones.This gift can be an intuitive sense that something is not right either in the words or actions of others.It can help others sift through healthy versus unhealthy relationships and commitments, identify spiritual warfare and the activity of the enemy, and point out deceit.</p>
