<p><strong>Prophecy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prophecy</strong> is the gift that God uses to convict His people of sin and their need for repentance.Prophecy today is the Holy-Spirit-empowered ability to speak God&rsquo;s Word&mdash;truth&mdash;into a situation, calling people to turn back to God, warning of the consequences of not doing so, and reminding people of God&rsquo;s promises and of His justice and judgment.Knowing the right timing to speak a word from God depends on the person with the gift of prophecy being prayerful and sensitive to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading.</p>
