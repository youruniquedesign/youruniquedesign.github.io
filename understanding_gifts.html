<h2 style="color:#0070c0">Understanding Spiritual Gifts</h2>
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">What is a spiritual gift?</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
A spiritual gift is defined by Scripture as a unique ability given by God through His Holy Spirit to believers in Jesus—for the purpose of bringing glory to Him and strengthening His church.  In addition, spiritual gifts are recognized and affirmed by the Body of Christ, and we see them evidenced in the life of Jesus and ministry of the early church.
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">The importance of spiritual gifts</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
Our assessment identifies 23 gifts mentioned or implied in the Bible.  Gifts are essential to the healthy functioning of the church.  ALL need to be exercised in a spirit of love.  ALL are given to individual Jesus-followers so that they might glorify God and strengthen the Body of Christ.  Spiritual gifts are how God has equipped us to serve Him.  God-given gifts make a far greater impact than simply using your own talents and abilities.   For further study about gifts, take a look at Romans 12-13, 1 Corinthians 12-14, Ephesians 4, and 1 Peter 2 and 4.  
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">God’s call and our response</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
Spiritual giftedness is rooted in faith and belief in Jesus.  At Pentecost in Acts 2, Peter says “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of our sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”  God calls us to Himself, we acknowledge our need for Him and come to Him in humility and repentance, receiving His forgiveness and the promise of new life.  That new life reflects God’s call on the whole of ourselves (including both our natural talents and the giftedness we receive through the Holy Spirit), and we respond in gratitude and service to Him and to others.  
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">God equips us with what we need to do His work</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
God does not simply call us to a life of generosity in all ways, He enables us to carry out His call through use of the gifts He gives us.  As He promises in Hebrews 13:20-21, He will equip us “with everything good for doing His will.”  And, Peter adds that as we do His will, we are using our gifts, individually and collectively “to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms” (1 Peter 4:10).

We hope that any spiritual gifts assessment you take helps you not only identify your God-given giftedness, but also starts you on (or helps you continue on) the journey of living into those gifts and further developing and using them.  We hope this journey also results in you learning how to better affirm and embrace the gifts of others, especially those you don’t have!
<h2 style="color:#0070c0">Your Spiritual Gifts and the Body of Christ</h2>
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">You are unique</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
Throughout Scripture, God makes it clear that each of us is precious to Him, created uniquely and specially for a purpose of His design.  We see in Psalm 139:14 that we are “fearfully and wonderfully made,” by God. Ephesians 2:10 adds that we are “God’s handiwork,” created do do good.
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">You are set apart for God</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
We have been selected—“set apart”-- by God for our life’s work.  As believers, we have become part of God’s forever family, “…now your sins have been washed away, and you have been set apart for God. You have been made right with God because of what the Lord Jesus Christ and the Spirit of our God have done for you” (1 Corinthians 6:11).  The Apostle Peter goes on to say: “you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light” (1 Peter 2:9).
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">You are called and equipped by God</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
You and I are called by God to do His work in the world AND equipped by Him to do that which He has called us to do.  Part of that equipping is giving each believer in Jesus Christ spiritual gifts—special abilities empowered by the Holy Spirit—to accomplish His purposes and bring Him glory.  Ephesians 4:11-13  says that gifts are given by God “to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.” We are not on our own in this.  God will do His work in and through us, as we are submitted to Him and sensitive to His leading.  Philippians 1:6 gives us confidence that God will complete that work that is begun in us.
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">We are TOGETHER the Body of Christ</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
Gifts are given to each of us to be used for ALL of us.  The Scriptures that reference spiritual gifts do so in the context of a group.  Chosen people, holy nation, Body of Christ, common good are all terms that remind us that we belong to each other, and that gifts are to be used for others.  Ultimately, our gifts are a way to steward what God has entrusted to us.
<h3 style="color:#0070c0">The context is LOVE</h3 style="color:#0070c0">
Ultimately, the context of using our gifts is in love:  Jesus said: “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you…” (John 15:12).  We will be known by our love shown to one another.  Paul goes on to say that our freedom in Christ is not a license to do whatever we want, but really a deeper call to serve each other lovingly: “For you, dear friends, have been called to live in freedom--not freedom to satisfy your sinful nature, but freedom to serve one another in love. For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Galatians 5:13-14  NLT).  And, 1 Corinthians 12 and 14,  the longest passages on gifts in Scripture are bookends for 1 Corinthians 13—known as the love chapter.  Paul makes it very clear that gifts are to be used in love—or they have no value.
