<p><strong>Healing </strong></p>
<p>The gift of <strong>Healing</strong> follows the pattern we see in the life and ministry of Jesus where healing was physical, mental, emotional, and/or spiritual. Often in Scripture healing is used by God to pour grace upon someone while simultaneously authenticating a message or a ministry. Always it is to show God&rsquo;s mercy and power. Sometimes healing is instant and sometimes it happens over time. Our God is a God of restoration and wholeness, and healing is one way in which we see Him reach deeply into individual lives.</p>
